<p>My website is coming along! I have made many changes over the last couple of weeks. I made a big change by moving 
from using the CSS Framework Skeleton to Bootstrap. I wanted to add some Javascript to my site without writing it all 
myself. I also like the CSS styles from Bootstrap better.</p>

<p>I haven't dabbled in animations yet, but I would like to at some point. One thing that I have observed over and over 
 again is that there is not <i>always</i> an answer, but a good majority of the time someone <!--more--> out there on the interwebs has 
 documented a solution. One of the things I would like to do for every post is take a screenshot of the homepage.</p>
