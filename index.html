            <h3>Hello and welcome to my website.</h3>
            <p>I created brycemueller.com to not only let you know more about me, but also to sharpen my skills as a Software Engineer. I love learning new things. So I thought, "Hey, what if I could build a website all by myself and learn new things along the way!" So here it is in all her glory!</p>
            <p>I have an about page if you want to read more about myself and my story. You'll also find a contact page above in the menu bar if you would like to contact myself for any reason. </p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3><small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span></small> Personal</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Bryce Mueller, if you couldn't already tell by the websites name. I come from the sun drenched land of Southwest Florida. I am in the weaning days of graduating from Florida Gulf Coast Univerity with a bachelors in Software Engineering. I have a wonderful wife Sara and a beautiful daughter Lily. <img class="profilePic img-responsive" src="assets/Profile-pic-small.jpeg" alt="Profile image"> </p>

            <p>The programming language I am most familiar with is Java. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
