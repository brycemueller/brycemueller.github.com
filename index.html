        <h3>Hello and welcome to my website.</h3>
        <p>I created brycemueller.com to not only let you know more about me, but also to sharpen my skills as a Software Engineer. I love learning new things. So I thought, "Hey, what if I could build a website all by myself and learn new things along the way!" So here it is in all her glory!</p>
        <p>I have an about page if you want to read more about myself and my story. You'll also find a contact page above in the menu bar if you would like to contact myself for any reason. </p>
