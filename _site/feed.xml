        <title>Things I&#39;ve learned in March</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My website is coming along! I have made many changes over the last couple of weeks. I made a big change by moving 
from using the CSS Framework Skeleton to Bootstrap. I wanted to add some Javascript to my site without writing it all 
myself. I also like the CSS styles from Bootstrap better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t dabbled in animations yet, but I would like to at some point. One thing that I have observed over and over 
 again is that there is not &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; an answer, but a good majority of the time someone out there on the interwebs has 
 documented a solution. One of the things I would like to do for every post is take a screenshot of the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;/assets/screenshot-2016-3-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Blog Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally creating my own website! I’ve had one hosted on Wordpress for a while, but I thought it was time I created 
one myself. I’m using GitHub to host it and Jekyll for the blog section. We’ll see how amazing it turns out to be. I hope 
amazing! Here’s to the future…&lt;/p&gt;
